# BotDemo

## 📌 Project Overview

**BotDemo** is a proof-of-concept automation project built with **C# and .NET**.  
The project demonstrates how structured data (such as Excel or CSV files) can be processed sequentially and used to automate repetitive, form-based workflows without manual intervention.

The user’s role is limited to providing the input file, while the system handles the execution logic automatically until all records are processed.
